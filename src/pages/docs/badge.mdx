# Badge Component

The badge component is a great way to convey the category of information quickly or to draw special attention to a small string.

## Usage

Some best practices of using badges include:

- Badges should be used sparingly to increase the importance of their existence.
- Any color in the theme can be used for a badge. Use your discretion to make sure badges are legible.
- Only the default, subtle variant should be used.

## Colors

To change the color of the badge component, you'll need to use `variantColor` as it is a themed component. Simply using the `color` prop will only change the color of the text.

```jsx
<Stack isInline spacing={2}>
    <Badge>Webinar</Badge>
    <Badge variantColor='primary'>Webinar</Badge>
    <Badge variantColor='blue'>Webinar</Badge>
    <Badge variantColor='red'>Webinar</Badge>
    <Badge variantColor='yellow'>Webinar</Badge>
    <Badge variantColor='green'>Webinar</Badge>
</Stack>
```

## Size
To change the size of the badge, you'll want to target the `fontSize` property. The default size is `xs`.

```jsx
<Badge fontSize="sm">Webinar</Badge>
```
