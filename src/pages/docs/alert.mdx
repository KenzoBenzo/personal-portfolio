# Alert Component

This component is used sparingly to denote important information. 


## Usage

Some examples of where this could be used include:

- To indicate a successful submission of a form or action
- Inside of documentation when context is needed
- Indicating a dangerous action like deleting or a potentially unwanted action like leaving without saving

How this should be used:
- The default, subtle variant should be used for triggered information such as toast messages
- The left-accent variant should be used for static information such as important information in documentation
- Additionaly, the `CloseButton` component can be added to an alert to make it dismissable.

## Status

There are 4 statuses with default styling based off of our [custom theme](/docs/theme/). The statuses available are:
- Success
- Info
- Warning
- Danger


## Variants

Although Chakra-ui supports many styling types, we will only use the `subtle` and `left-accent` variants that can be seen below.

### Subtle

The `subtle` variant is the default. No props are needed to denote this.

```jsx
<Stack spacing={4}>
  <Alert status="success" rounded="md">
    <AlertIcon />
    Data uploaded to the server. Fire on!
  </Alert>
  <Alert status="warning" rounded="md">
    <AlertIcon />
    Data uploaded to the server. Fire on!
  </Alert>
  <Alert status="info" rounded="md">
    <AlertIcon />
    Chakra is going live on August 30th. Get ready!
  </Alert>
  <Alert status="error" rounded="md">
    <AlertIcon />
    Data uploaded to the server. Fire on!
    <CloseButton position="absolute" right="8px" />
  </Alert>
</Stack>
```

### Left Accent

The `left-accent` variant is great for inline information. It requires the variant prop to be denoted.

```jsx
<Stack spacing={4}>
  <Alert status="success" variant='left-accent' rounded="md">
    <AlertIcon />
    Data uploaded to the server. Fire on!
  </Alert>
  <Alert status="warning" variant='left-accent' rounded="md">
    <AlertIcon />
    Data uploaded to the server. Fire on!
  </Alert>
  <Alert status="info" variant='left-accent' rounded="md">
    <AlertIcon />
    Chakra is going live on August 30th. Get ready!
  </Alert>
  <Alert status="error" variant='left-accent' rounded="md">
    <AlertIcon />
    Data uploaded to the server. Fire on!
    <CloseButton position="absolute" right="8px" />
  </Alert>
</Stack>
```
