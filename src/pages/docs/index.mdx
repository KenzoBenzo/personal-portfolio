# Docs Home

The documentation of a budding design system for side projects I work on, will go here!

## The docs stack

This documentation is custom built by myself. I am using:

- MDX
- Gatsby
- Chakra UI
- React Live
- Formik

## The components

The components themselves use Chakra UI as the base and are customized. I made this decision due to the deep level of thought that was put into things like darkmode, and accessibility.

- [Checkout the custom theme](/docs/theme/)
