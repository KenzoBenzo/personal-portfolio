# Docs Introduction

The documentation of a budding design system for side projects I work on, will go here! This section of my portfolio is a work in progress that I want to share early. I will be updating this on a regular basis as I learn more about needs of this design system.

## The docs stack

This documentation is custom built by myself. I am using:

- MDX
- Gatsby
- Chakra UI
- React Live
- Formik

---

## The components

The components themselves use Chakra UI as the base and are customized. I made this decision due to the deep level of thought that was put into things like darkmode, and accessibility.

- [Checkout the custom theme](/docs/theme/)
